        <h1>Short Story</h1>
                                 <p>Coffee Run</p>

       <p> It gets lonely here, because of the restrictions of Covid. I don't live in Missoula, as I would probably like to, but I am happy to live in Kalispell. To keep myself safe and healthy, I commit to remote learning, where if you were a Media Arts major before they merge, you are use to being glued to a computer. However as mentioned before, it gets lonely here. Especially if there's no zoom or skype meetings. So I've made a habit to walk over to the Common Ground cafe' to refill my mug and to happly socialize. It's the most human interaction outside my family I get. Friends? Those are the lovely angels who fill my thermos and happly tell me about there day. </p>

<p>Over the last several months, I've spent some of my free time illustrating the types of hot drinks Common Ground serves. Most of them are teas, but some of them are the Latte' Specials. Latte' Specials change weekly, determined by the season, and can stick around if the concoction gains enough popularity. One of those was the Gingerbread Latte'  (See left). This one came around the holiday season when cranberries and eggnog where the norm. Now normally when I did one of these compositions it's the cup, the drink and it's ingredients, remember most of them were teas. So I was puzzled on how to express the Gingerbread Latte'. I thought about place pieces of gingerbread over the warm syrup and milk but A) that could confuse the viewer, B) it could also look demented if I were to make them look like gingerbread men parts, and C) I couldn't make it, the gingerbread, too small. With size and style of the design, I decided to have them, the gingerbread men, help make the drink. Thus the final image.
